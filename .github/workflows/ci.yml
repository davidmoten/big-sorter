## Does continuous integration build with Java 8 and 11 and 
## if succeeds and due to a dependabot pull request (minor or
## patch verson change) it will automatically merge the PR. 

## Unlike many sample automerge workflows this does not rely 
## on third-party libraries apart from the official dependabot
## repository ones. This reduces the security risk significantly
## (we don't want to unknowingly merge malicious code or expose 
## secrets to a malicious third party).
